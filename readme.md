# Phase separation of the components of a binary fluid (AC)

Instructions/advices:
- The main paper to start with for the possible algorithms leading to a
practical scheme for solving the Cahn-Hilliard equation is Lee_CMS2014.pdf

- Jamet.pdf gives details about the physics of phase separation for a
binary fluid and the derivation of the Cahn-Hilliard equation you will
solve numerically.

- DJ.Eyre_1998.pdf is useful if you are interested in the way to
perform an operator splitting that will stabilize some of the schemes
you may write naively.

- TCGPhysica1995.pdf will possibly give you some ideas of diagnostics
that you can implement, once your solver will be running, to
characterize the patterns obtained in phase separation.
